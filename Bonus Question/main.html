        <h2>Question:</h2>
        <p>You have a JSON file named "employees.json" that contains information about employees in a company. Each employee has a name, department, and a nested object called "salary" that contains the base salary and bonus amount. Write a JavaScript function called calculateTotalCompensation that takes the path to the "employees.json" file as input. The function should calculate the total compensation (base salary + bonus) for each employee and return an object with the employee name as the key and their total compensation as the value.</p>
